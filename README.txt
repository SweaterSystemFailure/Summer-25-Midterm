C++ Midterm Project
Total Points: 100

Objective:
Design and build a C++ program of your choice that demonstrates your understanding of core programming concepts covered so far. You’ll apply a variety of tools and techniques including pointers, dynamic memory, binary search, file I/O, and classes.
This project gives you the freedom to choose your program idea, as long as it meaningfully applies the required concepts.

Your Midterm Must Include:
	Your program must use or demonstrate:
		Data types and data sizes
		File types (e.g., .txt for data I/O)
		Use of pointers
		Arrays 
		A binary search algorithm (on any other search)
		Use of strings
		File I/O (read from or write to a file)
		At least two classes (with meaningful interaction)

	Submission Requirements:
		You must submit the following in a GitHub repository with the following structure:
		Midterm/
		├── main.cpp
		├── [Other .cpp/.h files as needed]
		└── output.pdf  ← Your report with screenshots 

	output.pdf Must Contain:
		A brief explanation of your program (what it does, how it works)
		A list of concepts used (from the list above)
		Screenshots of your program running (showing all program screens, such as input prompts, output results, etc.)
		Mention any challenges you faced and how you solved them

How to Submit:
	Upload all your .cpp  files to a folder called Midterm in a GitHub repository.
	Add your output.pdf to the same folder.
	Submit the link to your GitHub repo via Canvas.
